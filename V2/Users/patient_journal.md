# Optinomic | Patient Journal

Every patient has a `Journal`.  The idea of this Journal-View is to show all the important ‘events’ of the selected user in a friendly timeline.  :fire: The following explanations could be different than your current installation. Clinics are able to enable/disable some functionality as they need. 


## Settings

#### Time-Filter-Settings
Basically you can select from what time-range you want to display data. 

1. By enabling the Time-Filter you can set the `year` and the `calendar-week`. Then all entries from the selected week are displayed.  

2. By disabling the Time-Filter all entries of the patent where displayed. 


#### Timline-Settings
