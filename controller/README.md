Controller
==========


####General:     Every module has inside `Lime Creator` a filed called `ngController`. Inside this `ngController` you will write the 'logic' of the given module.   

####AngularJSInside `ngController` you can write Javascript. Optinomic uses [AngularJS v1.2.10]( https://angularjs.org/) (HTML enhanced for web apps!). The ngController directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values.  
The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

MVC components in angular:

- Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties are accessed through bindings.
- View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
- Controller — The ngController directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values

Popular Directives you where going to use are: 
- The [ngRepeat directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat) instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item, and $index is set to the item index or key.
- The[ngShow](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) / [ngHide](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide) directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression provided to the ngShow attribute.
Also you should have at least a basic understanding of Data-Binding and Scopes:    
- What are [Scopes](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope)?
